# Day-One

**Day-One** is a minimal SwiftUI app designed to track the number of days without smoking.  
It focuses on simplicity, motivation, and a clean user interface.

## ✨ Features

- Displays the number of days since the selected quit date
- Motivational messages that evolve over time
- Manual day adjustment (useful for edge cases)
- Smooth animations using SwiftUI
- Haptic feedback for user interaction
- Dark, minimal aesthetic

## 🛠 Built With

- **Swift**
- **SwiftUI**
- **iOS 17+** (or compatible SwiftUI version)

## 📱 Screens & UI

- Large, centered day counter
- Context-aware motivational text
- Date picker to set the quit date
- Buttons for manual adjustment and reset

## 🚀 How It Works

- The app calculates the number of days between the selected quit date and today.
- A manual offset can be added to fine-tune the counter.
- Motivational messages change based on progress milestones.
- Animations trigger automatically when the day count changes.
